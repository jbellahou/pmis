    <p>Project MIS is a cloud-based information system designed to support best practices in project management. We call it "project management with training wheels" because proper methodology must be followed to use the system. Much like training wheels on a bicycle enforce (or make up for) proper balance, the structure of this system enforces best practices in project management.</p>
    <p>Originally designed in 2016 as a teaching tool for project management classes at a university, the system has grown from a basic tool for organizing a project and calculating earned value to a feature-rich system that integrates multiple aspects of projects and users. The system supports the creation of organizations and organizational resources; the creation and management of projects using the best processes and tools in project management methodology (project charters, stakeholder registers, work breakdown structures, activity lists, project schedules, project budgets, earned value management, critical path method, PERT analysis, progress reports, risk management, and commmunnication management); interfaces for stakeholders to view project progress and interact with the project team; interfaces for project team members to update progress, report costs, and communicate about issues; and interfaces for subcontractors to update progress and communicate about issues.</p>
    <p>Project MIS conforms to best practices in project management as defined by the <a href="https://www.pmi.org/" target="_blank">Project Management Institute (PMI)</a>. Much of the terminology in the system comes from the PMI publication, <a href="https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok" target="blank"><i>A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge</i></a>. According to PMI, the PMBOK &copy; Guide "is PMI's flagship publication and is a fundamental resource for effective project management in any industry. It has been updated to reflect the latest good practices in project management."</p>
    <p>The system is free to use. Feel free to use it to manage all of your projects!</p>
